		<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				I am an incoming junior at UCLA. My interests are plasma physics, fluid dynamics, and physics pedagogy. I am an aspiring physics student looking to engage in research in the near future.
			</p>

			<p>
				Three words that describe me are: curious, honest, and hopeful.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				I'm an incoming transfer student eager to join the wider research community. I'm curious to learn more about the world and take pride in what I do, inside and outside the classroom. I have a variety of interests and hobbies, and I can handle multiple responsibilities at once. I hope to engage in research during my time at UCLA and attend graduate school in the future.
