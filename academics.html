		<h1>Academics</h1>
			<p>
				My academic progress has been varied but there has been a throughline of exploration throughout it. I am an incoming Physics B.S. major at UCLA. What I love most about physics is its magnitude of scale and significance to the wider world. It represents Man's desire to understand more about the world in which we live. It also represents the inherent desire to always do more and do better in our current understanding.

		<h1>Coursework</h1>

			I have taken: PHYSICS 250 - 252 with labs. CHEMISTRY 200-210.
