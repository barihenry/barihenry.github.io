		<h1>My goals</h1>
			<p>
				I have many goals I want to achieve in my professional and personal life while at UCLA. I primarily hope to advance my academic career by taking relevant coursework
				in the fields of fluid dynamics and nuclear/plasma physics.
			</p>
		<h1>Short-term goals</h1>
		<p>
			In the short-term, I hope to advance myself academically-- both through coursework and research conducted in one of the many labs at UCLA. I hope to not just act but excel academically in order to make a name for myself in a network of working and academic physicists. I also hope to explore the different aspects of the physics major and find a branch or set of topics that excite me. I hope to join clubs and organizations that are meaningful to me in a personal sense, but also have significance to the broader world. Above all, I want to use my time at UCLA to gain a nefound sense of independence and reliance on myself as the director of my life story.
		</p>
		<h1>Long-term goals</h1>
				<p>
					In the long-term, I hope to get an academic career related to nuclear energy or plasma physics. Through this I belive I can have a career that is simultaneously manifestly necessary and highly explorative, creative, and tough. Personally, I want to achieve a sense of greater responsibility and contribution to a project far bigger than myself. This self-sublimation is the kernel of my self-actualization journey.
