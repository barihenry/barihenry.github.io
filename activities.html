		<h1>Activities</h1>
		<p>
				I engage in various activities, from academic, to creative, to physical.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Academic
		</h1>
		<p>
			I am a longtime player of quizbowl, an academic sport played in high schools and colleges around the country. I am an avid science specialist, able to answer many questions ranging from biology to pure mathematics. I am also a prospective member of UCLA's chapter for the Society of Physics Students, a nationwide organization of physics undergraduates who seek to learn more about the Universe. Alongside these organizations I also personally peers in mathematics, physics, and other STEM fields. Finally, I love to indulge in explorative self-study of any topic that interests me, from physics, to poetry, to history.

		<h1>
			Personal activities
		</h1>
		<p>
			Outside of the academic hustle, I enjoy other activities that let me explore other interests. At the gym and on the field, I love to push my body to see what it's capable of, whether it's a PR on a new lift or making progress on my Ultimate frisbee throws. I also enjoy playing the euphonium, a beautiful-sounding brass instrument that is a staple of the modern wind ensemble. Finally I love to bike, constantly tinkering on my self-built electric bicycle to see where it will take me next.
