		<h1>Professional</h1>
			<p>
				My primary professional goal is to become a research physicist. This is a long path but I believe UCLA's resources will provide a great start to my budding career. My research interests are currently in mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, and nuclear/plasma physics. I believe that being able to create sustainable, clean energy is not only the crisis of our generation, but also a major need to power the technology of the future. Through my research, I hope to pave the way for a cleaner, more advanced future.
			</p>
		<h1>Strengths and Values</h1>
		<p>
			My best strength is that I am meticulous and detail-oriented. I believe that in a field that's simultaneously math and concept-oriented, it is paramount to be able to handle details in a way that allows for greater insights without losing sight of the bigger picture. I take pride in whatever I do and believe that what I create is a manifestation of myself. My greatest value is truth, honesty, and clarity. I believe that in a changing media and political landscape, it is more important than ever to understand our relationship with truth and fight to get a better understanding of what is true over what is false.
